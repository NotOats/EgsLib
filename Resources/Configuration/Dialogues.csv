eden_dialogue_qSGa0xK,@d0Greetings commander. I have scanned the locking mechanism and computer and have determined how the mechanism works.\nEach time you access the terminal a new security code is generated between two random values. I can detect those values but cannot see what the code is.\nYou must guess the code until you input the correct code. If you input an incorrect code I can determine whether the code is higher or lower than your guess and adjust the code range accordingly.\nEach time you guess the code correctly a firewall will be breached and a vault door may open. Successfully hacking all firewalls will give the best rewards.\n<color=#ff0000>Failing too many times may lock you out of the system permanently and closing the hacking window may cause you to lose all hacking progress.</color>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

eden_dialogue_qGO90K0,Bulk trading involves ferrying extremely large trade goods from one galactic region to another to make a profit.\nYou will need a competent freighter with plenty of cargo space and the engines to move it to get the most out of each trip.\nIt will also help to be honored with the factions you are trading with as you may get a better price.\n@p9There are two types of bulk trading: Sealed packages and factory goods.\nSealed packages can be purchased from Trade Federation distribution headquarters in Tranquility and are then delivered to the distribution center of another faction. The size of sealed packages you can purchase will depend on your reputation.\nFactory goods can be purchased from various orbital bulk factories in one region and sold to the orbital bulk factories of another region.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sell it to them to get back your collateral plus a small fee for your services.\n@p9A certain reputation level is required before you are allowed to fulfill delivery contracts.\nSmall packages require neutral with the Trade Federation.\nMedium packages require friendly.\nLarge packages require honored.\nYou will also need to be neutral, friendly, or honored with the faction you are delivering to, so double check your reputation before accepting a delivery contract.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Things didn't exactly go as planned.\n@p9At first everything was good. We arrived in Andromeda along with a UCH military escort. The alien hyperspace drives burned out but that wasn't completely unexpected. Very soon after however, we encountered a hostile alien species known as the Zirax. Not just any Zirax. Zirax from House Abyssal. They opened fire on our fleet and Dr Smith used her ship to give the rest of the fleet time to escape.\n@p9Her ship was destroyed saving the rest of the fleet, but we did detect several escape pods being launched before the hyperspace drive overloaded. Nobody knows if she survived. \n@p9Now everyone is scattered throughout Andromeda. House Abyssal has placed a bounty on the heads of any Terran to be delivered to them alive.

eden_dialogue_qesiW4S,"We recently got out of a battle with a Zirax battlecarrier. We didn't take much damage but the fight drained our fuel reserves.\nWe're here trying to get back some power via an experimental solar panel setup, but so far haven't had much luck.\nPlus being between a star and a gas giant seems like a pretty good hiding spot.\nWe might be short on supplies but I'm sure there's a few we could spare for you if you check in with the quartermaster.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
eden_dialogue_Wmxu8uS,Hydroponics Engineer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
eden_dialogue_iE0qqG0,Sure. Tell me all about hydroponics bays.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
eden_dialogue_eCuWa0e,Sounds boring. I'll leave you to your plant stuff.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
eden_dialogue_GiKOO8i,"Hydroponics bays are advanced farming units that allow you to grow the equivalent of 9 crops in each bay.\nThe advantage is that it requires less manual effort to harvest because you only have to harvest once instead of 9 times for standalone crops.\n\nThey do not offer any yield or grow time benefit over planting 9 individual crops and they are more expensive to craft, so they are better for large scale farming operations where you might have to harvest dozens of bays.\n\n@p9They are costly to unlock and require fertilizer which can only be purchased from traders, but the benefits are well worth it for the time you'll save during your harvests of large farms.\n\nThe size of your farm will determine if these bays are worth it for you.\n\n@p9They will still require a grow light placed above them and a single hydroponics unit placed below them to function, and they do not protect your crops from any environmental hazards. If the crops inside die, you'll be left with an empty hydroponics bay and will have to craft a new one in an advanced constructor of the type of crop you want to plant.\n\nTreat them just like you would any other crop.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Seems like it will save you time from having to teleport back and forth so often.\n@p9A few tips for you. It seems the matter buffer will not allow you to do anything if the number of items in your personal inventory are less than the number of items it is looking for, so make sure to change the stack size to match how many items you can carry on you at one time.\nIt will also not allow you to put more items into it than it can hold, and it's only configured for those specific items so other items you will need to figure out how to transfer on your own.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

eden_dialogue_Ka4a4W8,@q0It means our position in the Andromeda galaxy is safer. @w1We could use this technology as a bargaining chip for trades or alliances.\n@w2Unfortunately I am not sure the Project Eden leadership will agree. @w1Our primary mission is to research the Progenitors and these drones do not seem to be related. @w2They may reassign me away from continuing my research on the drones. @w1That's where you come in.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
eden_dialogue_i04eq80,What can I do?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
eden_dialogue_CuSOW8q,@q0You could continue researching the drones. @w1Perhaps you can find a way to use the processors to create more powerful versions of other devices in the future.\n@w2There's also the potential threat the drones pose to the galaxy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
eden_dialogue_GS4euGm,You believe these drones are planning an attack?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
eden_dialogue_muLuqa2,"@q0Not planning, @w1no. @w1They seem concerned only with defending their territory and collecting resources.\n@w2And that's the problem. @w1While you have been searching for the Copernicus I have been in contact with representatives of the Free Colonists, Polaris Megacorp, the Trade Federation, and even a few pirates. @w2Even though there are reports that could be tied to these drones going back years no one seems concerned about them.\n@w2Until there is a clear and immediate danger I fear the major powers of the galaxy will ignore the threat until it's too late.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
eden_dialogue_OieSq0C,Well these drones are pretty far away. What risk do they actually pose?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
eden_dialogue_a8aWqEn,"@q0What worries me isn't the strength of their ships but that they are being ignored.\n@w2Once these drones have consumed all the resources on the outer rim, @w1where do you think they will go next?\n@w2By that time these drones will have grown into a terrifying swarm that will be impossible to stop. @w1They may be confined to the outer edges of the galaxy for now but you and I both know that they are coming. @w2Maybe not tomorrow, @w1but sooner than we'd like.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
eden_dialogue_eWe0CK0,So what do we do now?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
eden_dialogue_084CqUW,@q0You can continue to fight this drone swarm for more processors. Perhaps you can use them to make your ship more capable.\n@w2I have downloaded designs to your science station for new auxiliary CPU extenders for both small and large ships. @w1Access your science station to unlock them in your tech tree.\n@w2I also included a few other things as thanks. @w2Without your help we may have never known what became of the Copernicus and more people would have died. @w2I will mourn the captain and crew that were lost.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I have been keeping a close eye on you. You might call me an admirer of sorts.\nI write to you today with an opportunity for both of us. A win-win as you Terrans are so fond of saying.\nI have seen that you are an individual of questionable morals, and I have a problem that needs someone who isn't afraid to get their hands dirty.\n@p9 @d0Several colonist freighters have fallen behind on paying their insurance dues and are no longer insured. I need you to pay one of them a visit and give them a gentle reminder to renew their insurance policy before something bad happens to them. I think once the news spreads the others will be more than eager to pay up.\n@p9 @d0It's important that you only disable their ship, not destroy it. Try to avoid targeting their cores or generators as dead clients can't pay their dues and other freighter captains won't trust you for a period of time.\nDestroy their rear thrusters to force them to come to a complete stop and then board their ship and find the captain on the bridge. Tell the captain you are there to collect their insurance premium. Also demand to take one of their officers to make sure that future payments are delivered on time.\n@p9 @d0You can find these colonist freighters in most planetary orbits in habitable systems in neutral or Free Colonists territory.\nLet me know if this sounds enticing to you.
