# Tokens are instances of the item 'GenericToken' that will get their purpose in game.
# F.e. you can define a lock code for a door to be opened by a token that has the id of this lock code. Or you can
# define a quest or a PDA mission that needs a token to get finished.
# You don't need to define every token here, but if defined, the name and description will show up correctly.
# Set RemoveOnUse: true to remove it from the inventory of the player as soon as it was used.
# === Possible Usage ====
# 1. Place a Token with a certain key (= Meta ) to a inventory (f.ex. Container in an Alien POI): Open Console > 'give item Token 0001' > This will add a token to your inventory > place it in a container > Save POI (Only works with admin core POI at the moment)
# 2. Give a Token with a certain Meta to a player via PDA via Reward or InventoryOps: Use 'Token:0001' to give the Red Keycard for example
# 3. Give a Token in a dialogue: Use a function, f.ex AddItem('KeyCardBlack', 3, 1234)  = Will give the player 3x Keycard Black with the Meta 1234
# 4. Let a Trader sell/buy tokens: Enter an item to Trader config. Example: 'Item3: "Token:0001, 1, 1-2, 1-1, 1-2" = will buy and sell the Red Keycard from below
# 5. Use a Token in a loot table. Same as with a Trader. Use 'Token:0001' in your loot table/config 
# ========== IMPORTANT ===========
# - Currently only the item 'Token' (Itemsconfig.ecf id: 1305) can have a 4-digit META element. Any OTHER "keycard" named item or other items in general can NOT have meta info attached!
# - When working with the TokenConfig.ecf, adding custom names for the Token:Meta combination, you can use the console command 'token reload' when you are ingame. You do not need to restart the game when working with this file!
